I build tools businesses own forever.

No subscriptions. No vendor lock-in. One-time purchase, you own the code.

---

13 years in the startup ecosystem. PM, automation, sales, web dev. Self-taught everything.

When AI coding tools matured, I realized something: businesses don't need to rent software anymore. The tools they need can be built fast and owned forever.

What I've built:
→ VerifiedNode: 58,000+ contractor records, paying customers. Built with Claude Code.
→ LemonBrand ATS: Ontario ESA-compliant applicant tracking. One-time purchase.
→ Dozens of custom client tools: dashboards, automation, internal systems.

---

If you're here, you're probably:
• Tired of SaaS subscriptions that creep from $49/month to $299/month
• Paying for software that's 80% right and 20% wrong
• Wondering if there's another way

There is.

CUSTOM TOOL DEVELOPMENT
$5-30K one-time. 2-8 weeks. You own everything.
Working prototype in 1-2 weeks. Fixed pricing, no surprises.

TEACHING OPERATORS TO BUILD
Same methods I use. No coding background required.

Grant Everett You're right - the "why" matters. That's actually my point.

Old path: syntax → loops → data structures → years later, architectural decisions.

New path: start with the problem → "what are my options here?" → learn the tradeoffs in context.

Both get you there. One's pull, one's push.

Where we agree: vibe-coding to production isn't learning. If you can't explain why you chose something, you just copy-pasted with extra steps.

But "can you code offline?" tests memorization, not understanding. I've met devs who write sort functions from memory but can't tell you when NOT to use one.

Better metric: Can you defend your architecture to someone trying to break it?

That requires understanding. Doesn't require being offline.

"under these conditions, why wouldn't AI be a suitable replacement for a human writer?"

You answered your own question.

If the people paying you can't tell the difference between AI slop and your work, they never needed *you*. They needed content to exist. Box checked. Ship it.

I build tools. Same disease, different symptom. Client says they want custom, then asks why it doesn't look like the SaaS they saw on Product Hunt. "Creative" until it's unfamiliar. "Bold" until someone in the room gets nervous.

The work isn't the problem. It's making things for people who don't actually want what they're asking for.

You've got this.
