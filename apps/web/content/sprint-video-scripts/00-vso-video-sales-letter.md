## [00:00-00:30] HOOK - Personal Story

[TALKING HEAD: Natural lighting, slightly off-center frame, clean background]

I built my first tool in 7 days.

A Japanese recipe tracker. Nothing fancy. Just a little web app that helped me organize recipes I was learning to cook.

But here's the thing.

It worked. I made it. Me.

[Beat]

That was the moment everything changed.

Not because the tool was impressive. It wasn't. But because I realized: if I could build that, I could build anything.

## [00:30-01:30] PROBLEM - The Communication Gap

[TALKING HEAD with occasional cut to SCREEN SHARE showing AI chat interfaces]

Here's what most people get wrong about building with AI.

[SCREEN SHARE: Show a ChatGPT conversation with broken code output]

They try ChatGPT. It gives them code that looks right. They paste it somewhere. It doesn't work. They have no idea why.

[SCREEN SHARE: Show Cursor with red error squiggles]

They try Cursor or Claude Code. They get errors they don't understand. Red text everywhere. They close the app and never come back.

[SCREEN SHARE: Show YouTube tutorial paused]

They watch tutorials. "Build a todo app in 10 minutes!" Great. They follow along. It works. Then they try to build their own project... and nothing transfers.

[TALKING HEAD]

Here's what nobody tells you.

You're not learning to code. You're learning to communicate.

[Beat]

Two people can give Claude the exact same request and get completely different outputs. The difference isn't the prompt. It's the context. It's how you describe what you want. It's knowing when to plan and when to build.

The skill isn't coding. It's communication.

And that's teachable.

## [01:30-02:30] SOLUTION - The Sprint System

[SCREEN SHARE: Quick montage of different Sprint projects - a proposal generator, a calculator, a simple dashboard]

The 7-Day Sprint teaches you a system.

[TALKING HEAD]

Not a tutorial you follow once and forget. A system you use for every project.

Here's how it works:

[SCREEN SHARE: Show simple visual of the 7-day arc]

Days 0 and 1 are free. You set up your tools. You scope your project. Not a tutorial project - YOUR project. Something you actually want to build.

If it's not for you, you walk away. No credit card. No commitment.

[TALKING HEAD]

Days 2 and 3, you build your foundation and your first working feature. Real code. Running on your computer.

Days 4 and 5, you deploy it to the internet. Anyone with a link can see it. You get feedback. You iterate.

Days 6 and 7, you polish and ship. You record a demo. You share it with the cohort.

[Beat]

By the end of Day 7, you have a working tool. Live on the internet. Something that exists because you built it.

## [02:30-03:30] PROOF - What Others Built

[SCREEN SHARE: Show actual Sprint projects from previous cohorts - if not available, show mockups of project types]

Here's what Sprint graduates have built:

[SCREEN SHARE: Proposal generator interface]

A proposal generator. She was writing the same proposals over and over for her consulting clients. Now she inputs the client name, the project scope, the pricing - and it outputs a formatted proposal she can send in minutes.

[SCREEN SHARE: Client qualifier tool]

A client qualifier. He was taking discovery calls with bad-fit prospects. Now he has a tool that asks the right questions and tells him whether to book the call.

[SCREEN SHARE: Invoice calculator]

An invoice calculator. She was using spreadsheets to calculate complex project invoices. Now she has a tool that does it in seconds.

[TALKING HEAD]

None of these people had coding backgrounds. They had an idea. They had 7 days. They had a system.

That's it.

## [03:30-04:30] OFFER - Risk Reversal

[TALKING HEAD: Direct, sincere]

Here's how it works.

Days 0 and 1 are completely free. No credit card. You set up your tools, you scope your project, you see if this is for you.

If it's not? You walk away. No pressure.

If it is? $297 unlocks Days 2 through 7. That's the full build-and-ship experience.

And here's the thing most people don't expect:

If you complete all 7 days - and I mean actually complete them, do the work, ship the thing - that $297 becomes credit toward the 8-Week program.

So you're not paying to learn. You're paying to ship. And if you want to go deeper after, the money transfers.

48-hour money-back guarantee. If you buy and it's not what you expected, full refund, no questions asked.

## [04:30-05:00] CTA - Start Free

[TALKING HEAD: Sincere, not salesy]

Most people never build anything.

They think about it. They plan to learn someday. They save tutorials they'll never watch.

[Beat]

You can be different. Or you can be most people.

[Beat]

Days 0 and 1 are free. You can start right now. See if this is for you. Build something real.

Click below. Start free. Build something that didn't exist before you made it.

[END]
