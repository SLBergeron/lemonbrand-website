## [00:00-00:30] HOOK - Personal Story

[TALKING HEAD: Natural lighting, slightly off-center frame, clean background]

I built my first tool in 7 days.

A Japanese recipe tracker. Nothing fancy. Just a little web app that helped me organize recipes I was learning to cook.

But here's the thing.

It worked. I made it. Me.

[Beat]

That was the moment everything changed.

Not because the tool was impressive. It wasn't. But because I realized: if I could build that, I could build anything.

## [00:30-01:30] PROBLEM - The Communication Gap

[TALKING HEAD with occasional cut to SCREEN SHARE showing AI chat interfaces]

Here's what most people get wrong about building with AI.

[SCREEN SHARE: Show a ChatGPT conversation with broken code output]

They try ChatGPT. It gives them code that looks right. They paste it somewhere. It doesn't work. They have no idea why.

[SCREEN SHARE: Show Cursor with red error squiggles]

They try Cursor or Claude Code. They get errors they don't understand. Red text everywhere. They close the app and never come back.

[SCREEN SHARE: Show YouTube tutorial paused]

They watch tutorials. "Build a todo app in 10 minutes!" Great. They follow along. It works. Then they try to build their own project... and nothing transfers.

[TALKING HEAD]

Here's what nobody tells you.

You're not learning to code. You're learning to communicate.

[Beat]

Two people can give Claude the exact same request and get completely different outputs. The difference isn't the prompt. It's the context. It's how you describe what you want. It's knowing when to plan and when to build.

The skill isn't coding. It's communication.

And that's teachable.

## [01:30-02:30] SOLUTION - The Sprint System

[SCREEN SHARE: Quick montage of different Sprint projects - a proposal generator, a calculator, a simple dashboard]

The 7-Day Sprint teaches you a system.

[TALKING HEAD]

Not a tutorial you follow once and forget. A system you use for every project.

Here's how it works:

[SCREEN SHARE: Show simple visual of the 7-day arc]

Days 0 and 1 are free. You set up your tools. You scope your project. Not a tutorial project - YOUR project. Something you actually want to build.

If it's not for you, you walk away. No credit card. No commitment.

[TALKING HEAD]

Days 2 and 3, you build your foundation and your first working feature. Real code. Running on your computer.

Days 4 and 5, you deploy it to the internet. Anyone with a link can see it. You get feedback. You iterate.

Days 6 and 7, you polish and ship. You record a demo. You share it with the cohort.

[Beat]

By the end of Day 7, you have a working tool. Live on the internet. Something that exists because you built it.

## [02:30-03:30] EXAMPLES - What You Could Build

[SCREEN SHARE: Show demo project mockups]

Let me show you what's actually possible in 7 days.

[SCREEN SHARE: Unit converter tool demo]

A unit converter. Not just inches to centimeters - YOUR units. Fabric yardage. Recipe portions. Construction materials. Whatever weird conversion you do ten times a week.

[SCREEN SHARE: Budget tracker demo]

A personal budget tracker. Something that actually fits how YOU think about money. Categories that make sense to you. Calculations that match your specific situation.

[SCREEN SHARE: Recipe scaler demo]

A recipe scaler and timer. Input your recipe, scale it up or down, get adjusted measurements and cooking times. Saves it locally so you can use it offline.

[TALKING HEAD]

Notice what these have in common: they run entirely in your browser. No servers. No monthly hosting costs. Just a URL you can open on any device.

That's the sweet spot for your first build. Useful enough to actually use. Simple enough to ship in a week.

## [03:30-04:30] WHAT YOU'LL LEARN

[TALKING HEAD: Teaching mode]

Let me tell you what you're actually learning in these 7 days.

First, you learn how to scope. Most people fail because they try to build something too big. Day 0 teaches you how to cut a project down to something you can actually finish.

[SCREEN SHARE: Show project scope example]

Second, you learn how to communicate with AI. Not prompting - communicating. How to describe what you want. How to give context. How to debug when things go wrong. This is the skill that transfers to every future project.

[SCREEN SHARE: Show Claude Code conversation]

Third, you learn how to deploy. Your tool will be live on the internet by Day 5. A real URL anyone can visit. You'll understand how that works, and you'll be able to do it again.

[TALKING HEAD]

Fourth, you learn how to iterate. Ship something rough, get feedback, improve it. That loop is how real software gets built.

By Day 7, you don't just have a tool. You have a system you can repeat. That's the actual product here.

## [04:30-05:00] CTA - Start Free

[TALKING HEAD: Sincere, not salesy]

Most people never build anything.

They think about it. They plan to learn someday. They save tutorials they'll never watch.

[Beat]

You can be different. Or you can be most people.

[Beat]

Days 0 and 1 are free. You can start right now. See if this is for you. Build something real.

Click below. Start free. Build something that didn't exist before you made it.

[END]

## Production Notes

### B-Roll Needs
- Screen recordings of:
  - ChatGPT conversation with broken code
  - Cursor with error messages
  - YouTube tutorial paused
  - Demo project mockups (unit converter, budget tracker, recipe scaler)
  - Project scope example document
  - Claude Code conversation in action
  - 7-day arc visual/timeline

### Key Phrases to Hit
- "You're not learning to code. You're learning to communicate."
- "Not a tutorial - YOUR project"
- "No servers. No monthly hosting costs."
- "By Day 7, you don't just have a tool. You have a system you can repeat."

### Tone Notes
