## Cold Open Hooks (Quick Reference)

| Video | Hook Line |
|-------|-----------|
| VSO | "I built my first tool in 7 days." |
| Day 0 | "You're not learning to code. You're learning to communicate with something that codes." |
| Day 1 | "Planning catches mistakes before they become code." |
| Day 2 | "The thinking is hard. The code is cheap." |
| Day 3 | "This is the fun part. And the scary part. Things will break. That's the job." |
| Day 4 | "Anyone with a link can see it. That changes everything." |
| Day 5 | "You have a system now." |
| Day 6 | "Today is about stopping." |
| Day 7 | "Most people never build anything. You actually did it." |

## Brand Voice Checklist

Verify each script:
- [ ] Direct and action-oriented
- [ ] No buzzwords (revolutionary, game-changing, synergy)
- [ ] No emojis
- [ ] Clear explanation of why things work the way they do
- [ ] Acknowledges difficulty honestly
- [ ] Uses key phrases appropriately

### Key Phrases Used

- "You're not learning to code. You're learning to communicate."
- "Tools you own. No subscriptions." (VSO context only)
- "Ship, don't talk."
- "Working software, not mockups."
- "Iterate, don't start over."
- "The thinking is hard. The code is cheap."
- "Good enough shipped is better than perfect stuck."

## Recording Setup

### Talking Head
- Natural lighting (window or soft box)
- Clean, uncluttered background
- Slightly off-center framing (rule of thirds)
- Same camera position for all videos (consistency)
- Look slightly off-camera (toward interviewer position)

### Screen Share
- 1920x1080 resolution
- Font zoomed 125-150% for readability
- Mouse highlights enabled (Cursor app or Presenter app)
- Dark mode preferred for code
- Clear browser tabs (no embarrassing bookmarks)

### Audio
- External mic preferred
- Consistent room (same reverb profile)
- No background noise/music

### Transitions
- Cut between talking head and screen (no fancy transitions)
- "Let me show you what that looks like" → cut to screen
- Complete demo → cut back to talking head

- Scripts assume audience has zero coding background
- Both Cursor and Terminal are shown where relevant
- Emotional support woven throughout (not just practical instruction)
- Each script stands alone but references previous days appropriately
