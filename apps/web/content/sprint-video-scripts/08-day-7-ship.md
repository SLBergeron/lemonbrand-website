# Day 7: You Built Something Real

**Duration:** 7-8 minutes
**Purpose:** Demo, celebrate, reflect, what's next
**Key Insight:** Most people never build anything. You actually did it.

---

## [00:00-01:00] COLD OPEN

[TALKING HEAD]

Most people never build anything.

They think about it. They plan to learn someday. They save tutorials they'll never watch.

You actually did it.

[Beat]

Seven days ago, you had an idea. Maybe a vague one. Maybe you weren't sure if you could actually build it.

Now you have a working tool. Live on the internet. That you built. With your own hands and a very helpful AI collaborator.

[Beat]

Whatever happens next - whether you use this tool every day or never touch it again - you proved something to yourself this week.

You can build things. Real things. Things that work.

That's a skill that doesn't go away.

So before we get into the practical stuff: well done. Seriously.

## [01:00-03:00] CREATE YOUR DEMO VIDEO

[TALKING HEAD]

Let's record your demo.

You're going to create a short video showing your tool. I recommend Loom - it's free and easy - but any screen recorder works.

[SCREEN SHARE: Show Loom.com]

If you haven't used Loom before, here's the quick walkthrough:

[DEMO: Navigate to Loom]

1. Go to loom.com, create a free account
2. Install the browser extension or desktop app

[DEMO: Show clicking record]

3. Click record - choose "Screen + Camera" or just "Screen"

[DEMO: Show recording in progress]

4. Record your demo
5. Stop - you get a shareable link

[TALKING HEAD]

That's it. Don't overthink it.

[Beat]

Here's what to cover in your demo:

[SCREEN SHARE: Show list]

1. What is this tool? (one sentence)
2. Who is it for?
3. Show it working - walk through the main flow
4. What are you proud of?
5. What would you improve in version 2?

[TALKING HEAD]

Keep it short. 2-5 minutes is plenty.

Don't script it. Don't make it perfect. Just show what you built and talk about it like you're showing a friend.

"Hey, let me show you this thing I made this week..."

That's the vibe.

---

## [03:00-03:45] DEMO ANXIETY

[TALKING HEAD]

Some of you are nervous right now. About recording. About showing something that isn't perfect.

That's normal. You're sharing something you made. It's vulnerable.

Here's the thing: the cohort went through the same struggle you did. They understand what it took to get here. They're not judging. They're cheering for you.

[Beat]

Tips if you're nervous:
- Pretend you're showing a friend, not presenting to an audience
- It doesn't need to be polished
- You can re-record if you need to - Loom lets you try again
- An imperfect demo is still a demo

[Beat]

If your tool isn't working perfectly, demo it anyway.

Show what works. Acknowledge what doesn't. "This part isn't finished yet, but here's what it does..."

An imperfect demo is still a demo. You still built something.

---

## [03:45-04:30] SHARE WITH THE COHORT

[TALKING HEAD]

Post your video to the Discord.

Include:
- Your Loom link (or video file)
- Your live Vercel URL
- One thing you learned this week

[Beat]

Watch other people's demos. Leave comments. Celebrate each other.

This cohort went through the same struggle. They understand what it took. A "nice work" from someone who knows how hard it was - that means something.

---

## [04:30-06:00] WHAT'S NEXT - THE OPTIONS

[TALKING HEAD]

The Sprint is over. What now?

You have options.

[SCREEN SHARE: Show options]

**Option 1: Keep using what you built.**

Use your tool. See how it holds up in real life. Notice what's missing. Improve it over time.

**Option 2: Build something else.**

You have an ideas folder now. Pick one. Start the scoping conversation. You know the process.

**Option 3: Go deeper - the 8-Week Program.**

[TALKING HEAD]

Let me be honest about this. The Sprint taught you the fundamentals. Intentionally limited.

The 8-Week Program goes deeper:
- More complex projects
- Databases and real persistence
- Authentication - user accounts
- Mobile and native apps
- Production patterns

If you want to build more sophisticated tools - or turn this into a real skill you use professionally - the 8-Week is the next step.

[Beat]

And remember: if you completed all 7 days of the Sprint, your $297 becomes credit toward the 8-Week. It's not gone - it transfers.

**Option 4: Take a break.**

You just did a Sprint. It's okay to rest. The skills don't disappear. The ideas will still be there when you're ready.

[TALKING HEAD]

Whatever you choose is valid. One working tool is already more than most people ever build.

## [06:00-06:45] ADOPTION CONSIDERATIONS

[TALKING HEAD]

Quick note for those of you who want to use this tool beyond just yourself.

If this tool is just for you, you're done. Use it. Enjoy it.

If you want others to use it, there's more to think about:

For your team - you'll need some documentation. A simple "How to Use" page goes a long way. Ask Claude to help create it.

For your company - IT will have questions. Security, hosting, data handling. You may need to explain your process or get approval. The tool working isn't always enough - there's organizational buy-in to consider.

For clients - professional presentation matters more. Onboarding, error handling, support process.

[Beat]

None of this should stop you from building. But know that shipping to yourself is different from shipping to others. Both are valuable. Just different.

---

## [06:45-07:15] REFLECT

[TALKING HEAD]

Before you close this chapter, take a few minutes to reflect.

What did you learn?
- About building with AI?
- About yourself as a builder?
- About the process of going from idea to working tool?

What surprised you?
- What was easier than expected?
- What was harder than expected?

What would you do differently next time?
- Scope differently?
- Plan more, or less?
- Ask for help sooner?

[Beat]

Write these down. Future you will thank you.

---

## [07:15-08:00] FINAL CLOSE

[TALKING HEAD]

You started this Sprint with an idea.

You ended with a working tool, a deployed URL, a system for building, and a community of people who did it alongside you.

Not everyone finishes. You did.

That's worth something. Don't forget it.

[Beat]

Stay in the Discord. Help newcomers. Share what you build next.

The Sprint ends. The community doesn't. The skills don't disappear.

[Beat]

A month from now, you'll build something else. Maybe a lot of somethings. That's when you know it stuck.

[Beat]

Now go build the next thing.

[END - Personal sign-off]

## Production Notes

### Screen Recordings Needed
- Loom.com signup walkthrough
- Installing Loom extension
- Recording a demo (showing the interface)
- Example demo video structure (what to show)
- Discord posting example
- Options visual (4 paths)

### Gaps Addressed from Curriculum
1. **Loom how-to** - Step-by-step walkthrough included
2. **Demo anxiety tips** - Dedicated section with specific advice
3. **Tool not working / embarrassing to demo** - "Demo it anyway" section
4. **Organizational adoption complexity** - Team/company/client considerations
5. **Didn't finish** - "An imperfect demo is still a demo"
6. **8-Week pitch authenticity** - Honest framing, no pressure, credit reminder

### Key Phrases
- "Most people never build anything. You actually did it."
- "You can build things. Real things. Things that work."
- "An imperfect demo is still a demo."
- "The Sprint ends. The community doesn't."
- "Now go build the next thing."

### Tone Notes
- Celebratory but not saccharine
- Practical about next steps
- Honest about 8-Week without being pushy
- Personal sign-off adds warmth
- Recognition that this is an accomplishment

### Demo Prompts
None needed for Day 7 - it's mostly celebration and logistics.
