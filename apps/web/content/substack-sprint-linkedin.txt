I keep seeing it.

Someone tries Cursor or Claude, types "build me a landing page" and something appears.

It works. They're hooked.

Then they try to build something real and it falls apart.

Not immediately.

It works for a bit. You get most of the way there.

Then you hit something the model doesn't get. You rephrase. Try different words. It breaks something else.

You start over.

I've done this. A lot.

I was tired of writing proposals.

Same structure every time. Copy the last one, change the names, change the numbers.

Boring. Takes forever.

So I asked Claude to build me a proposal generator.

Boom - form, fields, button. I was flying.

Then I needed PDF export.

You can't just make a PDF. You build a React thing, style it, add a print button, print-to-PDF.

I didn't know that.

Then colors looked wrong when printed. Print stylesheets. Didn't know those existed.

Then I needed different sections for different clients. Had to learn JSON.

Every layer revealed something I didn't know I didn't know.

The problem isn't prompting.

It's how you work.

Most people treat AI like a magic box. Throw in a request, hope for output. Doesn't work, start over.

Starting over almost never fixes it.

Better context does. Systems that let you keep going instead of restart.

What actually helped:

1. Talk before you build. Not "build me this." More like "ask me questions about what i need"

2. Put context in files. Model forgets. A file called CLAUDE.md that tells it what the project is. "read claude.md and lets keep going"

3. Make the model push back. "pls poke holes in this. whats wrong with it"

I turned this into a 7-day sprint.

First two days are free. No email, no signup.

Link in comments if you want them.

Still figuring out the rest.
