# LemonBrand Growth Strategy

*Outlined January 23, 2026*

## The Core Loop

```
Daily 30-min builds → Video content → LinkedIn presence → Course interest → Beta testers → Testimonials → Product Hunt launch
```

Each piece feeds the next. The builds are real, the content is authentic, the audience grows because they're watching someone actually ship.

## The Daily Build Process

### Format: "30 Minutes to Ship"

**Structure:**
1. **Intro (1 min)**: State the problem. "Today I'm building a [X] because entrepreneurs need [Y]."
2. **Build (25 min)**: Screen recording of Claude Code session. Think out loud. Show the conversation, the iterations, the decisions.
3. **Demo (3 min)**: Show it working. Real output, real value.
4. **Wrap (1 min)**: What you learned, what you'd do differently, CTA to course/community.

**Recording Setup:**
- Timer visible on screen (accountability, tension)
- Claude Code in terminal
- Split screen when showing output
- Minimal editing—authenticity over polish

**Publishing:**
- Full video → YouTube (long-form, SEO, course funnel)
- Clips → LinkedIn (engagement, reach)
- Thread summary → Twitter/X (discoverability)
- Build artifacts → GitHub or Gumroad (lead magnets)

## Content Themes by Week

To avoid repetition and build a body of work:

**Week 1-2: Business Documents**
- Proposals, contracts, SOWs
- Theme: "Stop writing from scratch"

**Week 3-4: Operations**
- Meeting notes, time tracking, status reports
- Theme: "Automate the admin"

**Week 5-6: Marketing**
- LinkedIn posts, case studies, landing pages
- Theme: "Content without the struggle"

**Week 7-8: Analysis**
- Pricing, prioritization, decisions
- Theme: "Think clearer, decide faster"

---

## LinkedIn Strategy

### Posting Cadence
- **Daily**: Short insight or observation (text post)
- **3x/week**: Build video clip or screenshot
- **1x/week**: Longer-form post (methodology, lesson learned, behind-the-scenes)

### Content Pillars
1. **Build in public** — Show what you're making, warts and all
2. **Claude Code mastery** — Tips, patterns, mistakes
3. **Ownership philosophy** — Why subscriptions are a trap
4. **Founder journey** — The real experience of building businesses

### Engagement Strategy
- Comment on posts from target audience (agency owners, consultants, solopreneurs)
- Share others' wins genuinely
- Respond to every comment on your posts for first hour
- DM people who engage meaningfully (not pitching—connecting)

## Course Launch Sequence

### Phase 1: Beta (Current)
- [ ] 5-10 beta testers from School community
- [ ] Run them through 7-Day Sprint
- [ ] Collect feedback and testimonials
- [ ] Refine curriculum based on what actually works

### Phase 2: Soft Launch
- [ ] Testimonials on landing page
- [ ] LinkedIn announcement (personal story + what beta testers built)
- [ ] Email list (however small) gets first access
- [ ] Early bird pricing for first cohort

### Phase 3: Product Hunt
- [ ] Prep assets: demo video, screenshots, description
- [ ] Line up hunters (people in your network with PH presence)
- [ ] Coordinate launch day: be online, respond to comments
- [ ] Cross-post to LinkedIn, Twitter, communities

### Phase 4: Evergreen
- [ ] Rolling cohorts or self-paced option
- [ ] Builders Club as ongoing revenue
- [ ] Daily builds become course content library

## The Principle

> Entrepreneurs are looking for frameworks, for people who've gone before and done the thing they want to do and have solutions. You can solve those solutions. Give them answers to questions they might have.

Every build should answer a question an entrepreneur is actually asking:
- "How do I write a proposal that wins?"
- "How do I follow up without being annoying?"
- "How do I price my services?"
- "How do I make my website accessible?"

The builds are answers. The videos are proof you can deliver them. The course is "let me teach you to find your own answers."

## Next Actions

1. [ ] Pick first 5 builds for Week 1
2. [ ] Set up recording workflow (timer, screen capture, minimal edit process)
3. [ ] Schedule beta tester kickoff
4. [ ] Create simple tracking sheet for metrics
5. [ ] Write LinkedIn post announcing the daily build series
