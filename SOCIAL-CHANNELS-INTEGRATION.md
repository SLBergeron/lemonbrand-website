# Social Channels Integration Guide

**Purpose:** Complete reference for integrating Simon's social channels into LemonBrand.io
**Date:** November 13, 2025
**Tone:** Raw, honest, real - no fake guru shit

---

## Core Philosophy

**In a world full of fake, I'm something real.**

Everything I post is:
- Raw and unedited (or minimally edited)
- Honest about wins AND failures
- Showing the actual work, not just talking about it
- Building in public, documenting the messy middle

I don't do:
- Fake thumbnails with arrows and shocked faces
- Clickbait titles that don't match content
- Polished "personal brand" bullshit
- Guru energy or fake success

---

## Copy Guidelines

### Voice & Tone

**Do:**
- "Raw build sessions"
- "Honest thoughts"
- "Real work"
- "Mistakes and all"
- "Figuring it out"
- "What's actually happening"
- "Documenting everything"

**Don't:**
- "Professional tutorials"
- "Expert insights"
- "Proven strategies"
- "Subscribe for more awesome content"
- "Hit the bell icon"
- "Smash that like button"
- Any guru/influencer speak

### Social CTAs

**YouTube:**
- "Subscribe on YouTube" (not "Subscribe for more!")
- "Watch on YouTube" (not "Check out my channel!")
- "See the full build" (not "Full tutorial here!")

**TikTok:**
- "Follow @simonbergeron" (not "Follow for daily tips!")
- "Watch on TikTok" (not "More content on TikTok!")

**X/Twitter:**
- "Follow @SLBergeron" (not "Follow for updates!")
- "See on X" (not "Tweet at me!")

**Newsletter:**
- "Join the newsletter" or "Subscribe" (not "Sign up for exclusive content!")
- "Get weekly updates" (not "Never miss an update!")

**GitHub:**
- "View on GitHub" (not "Star my repos!")
- "See the code" (not "Check out my projects!")

---

## Social Proof Numbers

### Current Stats (Update as needed)

**As of Nov 13, 2025:**
- YouTube: ~127 subscribers (show this - early adopter appeal)
- Newsletter: ~50+ subscribers (show this)
- TikTok: (check and add)
- X/Twitter: (check and add)

**How to display:**
```
Join 127+ people following along on YouTube
Join 50+ builders in the weekly newsletter
```

**Why show small numbers:**
- Honesty (matches your brand)
- Early adopter appeal ("Be early")
- Shows momentum without being fake

**Don't:**
- Inflate numbers
- Hide small numbers
- Use vague language like "Join thousands!"

---

## Integration Priority

### Phase 1: Critical (Do First)
1. **Footer enhancement** - Visible on every page
2. **Homepage "Follow Along" section** - Main traffic entry point
3. **Hero section social line** - First thing people see

### Phase 2: Important (Do Second)
4. **Templates page watch CTA** - Connects content to templates
5. **Projects page build videos** - Shows proof of work
6. **Homepage latest videos** - Shows active creation

### Phase 3: Nice to Have (Do Third)
7. **Work With Me social proof** - Builds credibility
8. **Navigation social icons** - Persistent access
9. **About page social integration** - Complete story

---

## Component Structure Needed

### 1. Social Links Component
```jsx
// Reusable social links with icons and descriptions
<SocialLinks
  variant="full" // full descriptions or compact
  channels={["youtube", "tiktok", "twitter", "newsletter", "github"]}
  showCounts={true}
/>
```

### 2. Latest Videos Component
```jsx
// Shows 3 most recent YouTube videos
<LatestVideos
  count={3}
  showDescription={true}
/>
```

### 3. Follow CTA Component
```jsx
// Reusable CTA for following on platforms
<FollowCTA
  platform="youtube" // or "tiktok", "twitter", etc.
  variant="primary" // or "secondary"
  text="Subscribe on YouTube"
/>
```

---

## URL Constants

**Add to `/constants/links.ts` (or create if doesn't exist):**

```typescript
export const SOCIAL_LINKS = {
  YOUTUBE: "https://www.youtube.com/@slbergeron",
  YOUTUBE_HANDLE: "@slbergeron",
  TIKTOK: "https://www.tiktok.com/@simonbergeron",
  TIKTOK_HANDLE: "@simonbergeron",

  TIKTOK: "Honest thoughts on building businesses. No dancing, no trends.",
  TWITTER: "Real-time updates on what I'm building. Wins and failures.",
  NEWSLETTER: "Every Monday: What I built, what I learned, what's next.",
  GITHUB: "The actual code behind what I'm building.",
} as const;

export const SOCIAL_COUNTS = {
  YOUTUBE_SUBS: 127,

  // Update these as they grow
} as const;
```

---

## Design Guidelines

### Icons
- Use simple, outline-style icons (not filled)
- Consistent size across all social links
- Orange/yellow accent on hover (matches brand)

### Layout
- Social links always in order: YouTube → TikTok → X → Newsletter → GitHub
- Desktop: Horizontal or grid layout
- Mobile: Vertical stack

### Colors
- Default: Neutral gray
- Hover: Orange gradient (matches CTA buttons)
- Active: Orange solid

### Spacing
- Generous padding around social sections
- Clear visual separation from other content
- Social links should feel integrated, not tacked on

---

## Content Examples

### Homepage Hero Update

**Current:**
```
Building AI Agent Businesses in Public

I build modular AI systems that generate revenue,
and teach you how to do the same

[Download Free Templates]  [See What I'm Building]
```

**Add below CTAs:**
```
👇 Follow along: [YouTube] • [TikTok] • [X] • [Newsletter]
```

Or more explicit:
```
Follow the build: [YouTube icon] YouTube • [TikTok icon] TikTok • [X icon] X • [Newsletter icon] Newsletter
```

---

### Email Signatures (Bonus)

**For newsletter emails, add:**
```

📱 TikTok: tiktok.com/@simonbergeron (honest business talk)
🐦 X: x.com/SLBergeron (real-time updates)
💻 GitHub: github.com/SLBergeron (open source code)
```

---

## Video Embed Strategy

### YouTube Video Embeds

**Where to embed:**
- Homepage: Latest 3 videos
- Projects page: Relevant build videos per project
- Templates page: Template usage videos (when available)

**How to embed:**
```jsx
// Option 1: YouTube iframe (simple)
<iframe
  src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/VIDEO_ID"
  title="Video title"
  allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"
  allowFullScreen
/>

// Option 2: Custom video component with thumbnail
<VideoEmbed
  videoId="VIDEO_ID"
  thumbnail="/path/to/thumbnail.jpg"
  title="Video title"
  views={287}
  published="2 days ago"
/>
```

**Design:**
- 16:9 aspect ratio
- Rounded corners (matches site design)
- Border on hover
- Play button overlay on thumbnail

---

## Mobile Optimization

### Social Links on Mobile
- Stack vertically
- Full-width buttons
- Larger tap targets (48px minimum)
- Icons left-aligned, text centered

### Video Grid on Mobile
- Single column
- Maintain 16:9 aspect ratio
- Swipeable if more than 3 videos

---

## Tracking & Analytics (Optional)

**Track social link clicks:**
- Which social platform gets most clicks from which page
- Conversion: Site visitor → Social follower
- Most effective CTAs

**Don't need fancy analytics. Simple tracking:**
- UTM parameters on social links
- Google Analytics events
- Kit.com tracks newsletter signups already

---

## Maintenance

### When to Update

**Weekly:**
- Newsletter subscriber count (if it changes significantly)
- Latest videos section (when you post new content)

**Monthly:**
- YouTube subscriber count
- Review and update social descriptions if strategy changes

**As Needed:**
- Add new platforms if you join them
- Remove platforms if you abandon them (be real about it)

---

## Launch Checklist

Before pushing live:
- [ ] All social URLs tested and working
- [ ] Icons displaying correctly
- [ ] Social descriptions match brand voice
- [ ] CTAs clear and not fake/salesy
- [ ] Mobile responsive
- [ ] Footer social section enhanced
- [ ] Homepage "Follow Along" section added
- [ ] Templates page social CTAs added
- [ ] Projects page video links added
- [ ] Constants file created with all URLs

---

## The Bottom Line

**Every social link should:**
1. Be honest about what people will find
2. Match your "raw and real" brand
3. Not feel like desperate "follow me" energy
4. Show you're actively building and sharing
5. Make it easy to follow in their preferred format

**The goal isn't virality. The goal is documentation.**

People who vibe with your raw, honest approach will follow.
People who want polished guru content won't.

That's the filter. That's the point.
