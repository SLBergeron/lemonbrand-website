## What cookies are

Cookies are tiny text files stored on your device when you visit a website. They help websites remember things about you—like whether you're logged in, what's in your cart, or which pages you've visited.

**That's it.** No magic. No surveillance state. Just small files that make websites work.

---

## What this site uses

### Essential Cookies

**Purpose:** Make the website actually function.

**What they do:**
- Remember your session while browsing
- Keep forms working properly
- Maintain security settings
- Store your preferences (like dark mode)

**Can you disable them?** Technically yes, but the site won't work right.

**Duration:** Session cookies (deleted when you close the browser) and some that last up to 1 year.

### Analytics Cookies

**Purpose:** See what pages people visit and where traffic comes from.

**What we track:**
- Page views and visit duration
- Referral sources (how you found the site)
- General location (country/region, not exact address)
- Device type (mobile, desktop, etc.)

**What we don't track:**
- Your browsing history on other sites
- Personal identity (unless you voluntarily provide it)
- Keystroke patterns or mouse movements
- Anything invasive or creepy

**Tools we use:**
- Basic analytics (likely Google Analytics or similar)
- No ad tracking pixels
- No third-party marketing cookies

**Can you disable them?** Yes. Use your browser settings or opt-out tools. The site still works fine without them.

**Duration:** Up to 2 years (standard analytics cookie lifetime).

### Form Cookies (Kit/ConvertKit)

**Purpose:** Handle newsletter signups and form submissions.

**What they do:**
- Remember if you've already signed up
- Track attribution (how you found the form)
- Prevent duplicate submissions
- Manage subscription preferences

**Third party:** Kit (ConvertKit) handles these. Their privacy policy covers how they use cookies: [convertkit.com/privacy](https://convertkit.com/privacy)

**Can you disable them?** Yes, but you won't be able to subscribe to the newsletter.

**Duration:** Varies, typically up to 1 year.

### Calendar Booking Cookies (Cal.com)

**Purpose:** Handle meeting bookings and scheduling.

**What they do:**
- Remember your timezone
- Store booking preferences
- Maintain session during scheduling
- Prevent double-booking

**Third party:** Cal.com handles these. Their privacy policy: [cal.com/privacy](https://cal.com/privacy)

**Can you disable them?** Yes, but you won't be able to book calls through the site.

**Duration:** Varies, typically session-based with some lasting up to 1 year.

---

## What we don't use

**No advertising cookies.** I don't run ads or sell ad space. No Facebook Pixel. No Google Ads tracking. None of that.

**No cross-site tracking.** I don't follow you around the internet. What you do on other sites is your business.

**No behavioral profiling.** I'm not building a psychological profile of you to manipulate your decisions.

**No selling your data.** Your cookie data isn't for sale. Ever.

## How to control cookies

### Browser Settings

**All major browsers let you:**
- Block all cookies
- Block third-party cookies only
- Delete existing cookies
- Get warnings before cookies are set

**How to do it:**
- **Chrome:** Settings → Privacy and security → Cookies and other site data
- **Firefox:** Settings → Privacy & Security → Cookies and Site Data
- **Safari:** Preferences → Privacy → Cookies and website data
- **Edge:** Settings → Cookies and site permissions → Cookies and site data

### Browser Extensions

**Cookie management tools:**
- Privacy Badger (blocks tracking cookies)
- uBlock Origin (blocks ads and trackers)
- Cookie AutoDelete (automatically clears cookies)

### Do Not Track (DNT)

**Most browsers have a "Do Not Track" setting.** I respect it. If your browser sends a DNT signal, I honor that preference.

**Reality check:** Not all websites respect DNT. I do, but it's not legally enforceable everywhere.

---

## Mobile devices

### iOS (Safari)
Settings → Safari → Block All Cookies (or customize)

### Android (Chrome)
Chrome app → Settings → Site settings → Cookies

### In-app browsers
If you're opening links from apps (Facebook, Instagram, etc.), those browsers may have their own cookie policies. I don't control that.

---

## Cookie consent

**EU visitors:** Cookie consent banner appears on first visit. You can accept, reject, or customize which cookies you allow.

**Everyone else:** Cookies are used by default. You can disable them in your browser settings anytime.

**Your choice matters.** Essential cookies are necessary for the site to work, but analytics and third-party cookies are optional. Disable them if you want.

---

## Changes to cookies we use

**If I add new cookies:** I'll update this policy and change the "Last Updated" date.

**Material changes:** If I start using cookies in a significantly different way (like adding advertising), I'll notify subscribers via email.

**Check the date at the top.** If you want to see what changed, compare against your last visit.

---

## Data retention

**Session cookies:** Deleted when you close your browser.

**Persistent cookies:** Expire after their set duration (anywhere from 30 days to 2 years).

**You can delete them anytime.** Clear your browser cookies and they're gone immediately.
