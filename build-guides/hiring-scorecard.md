# Hiring Scorecard

You're hiring. You need to interview people. But what questions do you ask? How do you compare candidates objectively instead of just going with your gut?

No database for the basic version—role in, scorecard out. If you wanted to track candidates over time, you'd add persistence, but this is the 30-minute tool.

The audience is founders and managers who don't hire often enough to have a system, but need to make good decisions when they do. The problem is inconsistency—different questions for different candidates, no clear criteria, decisions based on vibes.

Input: the role you're hiring for, key responsibilities, must-have skills, nice-to-haves, any cultural factors that matter. Output: a structured interview guide with questions mapped to criteria, plus a scoring rubric.

The model generates questions that actually reveal what you need to know. Not "what's your greatest weakness" but questions tied to the specific skills and situations the role requires. Plus a simple 1-5 scale for each criterion so you can compare candidates.

One prompt that understands competency-based interviewing. Feed it the role details, have it output questions grouped by skill area with scoring guidance for each.

Demo: "Hiring a junior developer, needs React and API experience, must communicate clearly, bonus if they've worked remote." Run it. Show the interview guide: technical questions, scenario questions, communication assessment, scoring rubric. "Now every candidate gets the same evaluation."

Hook: bad hires are expensive. A consistent process helps you find the right person—not just the best interviewer.
