# Follow-Up Email Writer

You had a call. It went well. Now you need to follow up, and you're staring at a blank email trying to remember exactly what you discussed and what the right tone is.

No database. Context in, email out.

The audience is salespeople, consultants, anyone who does calls and needs to follow up professionally. The problem isn't that follow-ups are hard—it's that they're easy to overthink or procrastinate on.

Input: meeting notes or summary, what you want the follow-up to accomplish (book next call, send proposal, just stay warm), any specific things you promised to include. Output: a ready-to-send email.

The logic is about context awareness. The model reads what happened in the meeting, understands the relationship stage, and writes something that feels personal and specific—not a template.

One prompt. Feed it the context, tell it the goal, let it write. Maybe specify tone (formal, friendly, brief).

Demo: paste meeting summary, select "goal: book technical demo," run it. Show an email that references specific things from the call. "This doesn't feel like a template because it isn't."

Hook: follow-ups close deals. This makes sure you send them while the conversation is still warm.
