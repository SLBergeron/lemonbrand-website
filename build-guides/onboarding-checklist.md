# Client Onboarding Checklist

You signed a new client. Now what? Every service business has an onboarding process, but most people wing it every time. Things get forgotten, clients feel confused, you look disorganized.

Could use a database if you want to track progress across clients, but the basic version is stateless—generate a checklist, use it, done.

The audience is agencies, consultants, service providers—anyone who brings on clients and needs a consistent process. The value is looking professional and not forgetting the welcome email or the Slack invite or the kickoff call.

Input: what service are you providing, any client-specific details (name, project type, special requirements). Output: a customized onboarding checklist with tasks, timeline, and who's responsible.

The model generates based on best practices for that service type. If you're an agency, it knows you need contracts, briefs, access credentials, kickoff meetings. If you're a consultant, different flow. The more context you give it, the more tailored it gets.

One prompt that understands onboarding patterns. Feed it the service type and any specifics, get back a checklist you can actually use.

Demo: "New client for web development project, 8-week timeline, they're a SaaS company." Run it. Show the checklist: contract signed, invoice sent, Slack channel created, kickoff scheduled, credentials collected, project brief reviewed. "Week one handled."

Hook: first impressions matter. A smooth onboarding makes you look like you've done this a thousand times—even if it's client number three.
