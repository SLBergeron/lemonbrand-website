# Meeting Summarizer

You finish a call, you've got a transcript or your own scattered notes, and now you need to remember what actually happened. What did they agree to? What do you need to do? What's the follow-up?

No database. Paste in, get out, move on with your day.

The audience is anyone who takes calls—founders, consultants, salespeople. The problem is that raw transcripts are useless for action. You need the signal pulled out.

Input is the transcript or notes. Output is three things: a short summary (what was this meeting about in 2-3 sentences), action items (who does what by when), and key decisions (what got agreed upon).

One prompt, maybe two if you want to separate extraction from formatting. The model reads through, identifies commitments and decisions, structures them cleanly.

The satisfying moment: paste a 45-minute transcript, get a half-page summary you can actually use. Put it in your CRM, send it to the client, whatever.

Video hook: meetings are only valuable if you act on them. This tool makes sure nothing falls through the cracks.
