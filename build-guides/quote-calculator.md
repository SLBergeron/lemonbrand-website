# Quote Calculator

Client asks "how much?" and you fumble. You know your rates, you have a sense of scope, but pulling a confident number out of thin air is stressful. You either lowball and regret it or highball and lose the deal.

No database. Requirements in, quote out.

The audience is freelancers and consultants who struggle with on-the-spot pricing. The problem is that pricing requires math, judgment, and confidence—all at once, often on a call.

Input: what the project is, your hourly rate or day rate, estimated complexity (simple/medium/complex), any known scope items. Output: a calculated quote with breakdown, maybe multiple options (good/better/best).

The logic is simple: take your rate, estimate hours based on complexity, add buffer for unknowns, calculate total. The model helps with the estimation part—"a landing page is typically X hours, a full website is Y."

One prompt that understands project estimation. Feed it the scope, have it output a quote with line items and assumptions. The transparency of showing the math builds confidence.

Demo: "Custom dashboard for a small business, medium complexity, my rate is $150/hour." Run it. Show the breakdown: 25-30 hours estimated, buffer for revisions, quote range $4,500-$5,500. "Now I can say a number with confidence because I know how I got there."

Hook: confident pricing wins deals. This gives you the math so you're not guessing.
