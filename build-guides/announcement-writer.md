# Announcement Writer

You have news. New feature, new hire, new partnership, price change, whatever. You need to communicate it—maybe to customers, maybe publicly, maybe to your team. Drafting the right tone and message takes longer than it should.

No database. News in, communications out.

The audience is founders and marketers who need to announce things but overthink the wording. The problem is that announcements have stakes—say it wrong and customers panic or miss the point entirely.

Input: what's the news, who's the audience, what do you want them to feel (excited, reassured, informed), any key details that must be included. Output: announcement copy tailored to the channel—email, social, press release, internal memo.

The model adjusts tone and format based on audience and channel. A tweet is different from an email to customers is different from a press release. Same news, different framing.

One prompt that asks for channel and audience, then formats appropriately. Maybe output multiple versions for different channels.

Demo: "Launching a new pricing tier, telling existing customers, want them to feel valued not squeezed." Run it. Show the customer email—acknowledging them, explaining the change, grandfather clause if applicable. "This is how you communicate without backlash."

Hook: announcements go wrong when you don't think about how the audience will receive it. This forces that thinking and gives you the words.
