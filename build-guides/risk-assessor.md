# Risk Assessor

You're planning a project or making a decision. You know there are risks, but you haven't thought them through systematically. You're optimizing for the best case and hoping nothing goes wrong.

No database. Plan in, risk analysis out.

The audience is founders and project managers making decisions with uncertainty. The problem isn't that risks are unknown—it's that they're unexamined. Naming them makes them manageable.

Input: what you're planning (project, launch, hire, investment), what you know about the situation, any constraints or dependencies. Output: a risk analysis—what could go wrong, how likely, how severe, what's the mitigation.

The model thinks through scenarios you might not have considered. Technical risk, market risk, timeline risk, dependency risk, people risk. For each: likelihood, impact, and what you'd do if it happened.

One prompt that applies risk assessment frameworks. Feed it your plan, have it output a risk matrix with ratings and mitigations. Not to scare you—to prepare you.

Demo: describe a project launch with dependencies. Run it. Show the risk matrix—5 risks, each with likelihood/impact and mitigation. "Now I know what to watch for. No surprises."

Hook: optimism is great for starting things, terrible for planning them. This makes you think about what could go wrong before it does.
