# Landing Page Copy

You're building a landing page. The design is the easy part. The copy—the headline, subhead, features, social proof, CTA—that's where you get stuck staring at a blinking cursor.

No database. Product and audience in, copy out.

The audience is founders and marketers launching something—a product, a service, an event. The problem is that good landing page copy requires clarity about your value prop, your audience, and your differentiators. Most people have this in their head but can't articulate it.

Input: what you're offering, who it's for, the main problem it solves, key benefits (not features), any social proof you have, what you want visitors to do. Output: complete landing page copy—headline, subhead, feature sections, testimonial framing, CTA.

The model structures your thinking. It forces you to be clear about benefits vs features, to lead with the problem, to end with a clear action. The output is wireframe-ready copy you can drop into any page builder.

One prompt that understands landing page psychology: headline grabs, subhead explains, body proves, CTA converts. Give it your inputs, have it output each section.

Demo: describe a simple product. Run it. Show the full copy—headline, 3 feature blocks, testimonial treatment, CTA. "This is what goes on the page. Now I just design around it."

Hook: design without copy is decoration. This gets the words right before you touch Figma.
