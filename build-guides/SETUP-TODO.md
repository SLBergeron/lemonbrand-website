# Recording Setup TODO

Before starting daily builds:

## 1. Clean Recording Environment
- [ ] Create new Mac user account (recording-only)
- [ ] Install Screen Studio
- [ ] Set up automation to auto-open on login:
  - Screen Studio
  - Terminal
  - Timer app
- [ ] No Slack, no notifications, no distractions
- [ ] Standardize post-recording workflow (export → trim → upload → clip for LinkedIn)

## 2. Audio Setup
- [ ] Get a good USB mic
- Options:
  - Shure MV7 (~$250)
  - Rode NT-USB (~$170)
  - Audio-Technica AT2020 (~$150)
- Audio quality matters more than video for retention
