# Feature Prioritizer

You've got a list of things you could build. Users are asking for features, you have your own ideas, stakeholders have opinions. How do you decide what to do next?

No database. Ideas in, ranked roadmap out.

The audience is product people, founders, anyone managing a backlog who feels overwhelmed by options. The problem isn't having ideas—it's having too many and no clear framework for choosing.

Input: a list of features or ideas, optionally with context (who requested it, estimated effort, potential impact). Output: a prioritized list with reasoning, using a framework like impact vs effort, RICE, or whatever you prefer.

The model's job is to apply structured thinking. You give it the raw list and whatever context you have, it scores each item and ranks them. Not to make the decision for you—but to give you a starting point that's more rigorous than gut feel.

One prompt that understands prioritization frameworks. Feed it your features with context, have it score on impact (high/medium/low), effort (high/medium/low), and output a ranked list with reasoning for each.

Demo: list 8 features with rough descriptions. Run it. Show the ranked output with scores and reasoning. "Now I know what to build first—and I can explain why to my team."

Hook: prioritization is strategy. Most people do it by gut. This gives you a framework you can actually defend.
