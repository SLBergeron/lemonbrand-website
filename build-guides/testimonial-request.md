# Testimonial Request Writer

You finished a project. The client is happy. You should ask for a testimonial. But the ask feels awkward, and you're not sure what to say.

No database. Context in, email out.

The audience is anyone who does client work and knows they need social proof but hates asking for it. The problem is the awkwardness—you don't want to seem needy, you don't want to impose, so you just don't ask. And then you have no testimonials.

Input: client name, what you did for them, any specific results or wins, your relationship with them (formal, friendly, etc.). Output: a personalized ask that feels natural, not templated.

The model writes the email for you—acknowledging the work you did together, mentioning the specific outcomes, making the ask easy (maybe suggesting they just reply with a few sentences, or offering to draft something for their approval).

One prompt that understands the psychology of asking. Make it easy, make it specific, make it about them (their success) not you (your need for testimonials).

Demo: "Just finished a website for a local gym, they got 40% more bookings, we have a friendly relationship." Run it. Show the email—warm, specific, easy to say yes to. "Now I'll actually send it instead of putting it off."

Hook: testimonials are the best marketing you'll never have if you don't ask. This makes asking easy.
