# Bio Generator

Someone asks for your bio. A podcast, a conference, a website feature. You stare at the blank page trying to describe yourself without sounding either boring or braggy.

No database. Context in, bios out.

The audience is anyone with a personal brand—founders, consultants, speakers, freelancers. The problem is that writing about yourself is uniquely awkward. You know what you've done, but turning it into compelling copy that doesn't feel cringe is hard.

Input: your background (key facts, achievements, current role), what the bio is for (website, speaker intro, podcast guest, etc.), desired length (one-liner, paragraph, full page), tone (professional, casual, playful). Output: multiple bio versions you can choose from.

The model takes your raw facts and turns them into narrative. It knows the difference between a one-liner that goes under a headshot and a full speaker bio that needs to build credibility. It handles the third-person thing ("Simon Bergeron is...") without making it weird.

One prompt with clear instructions about length and tone. Have it output 2-3 variations so you can pick the one that feels right.

Demo: list your key facts and achievements. Specify "conference speaker bio, professional but warm." Run it. Show three versions—short, medium, long. "Now I just pick the one that sounds like me."

Hook: you need a bio for everything and hate writing them. This gives you options in 30 seconds.
