# Proposal Generator

This one's for consultants and freelancers who hate writing proposals. They sit down after a good discovery call, notes everywhere, and then spend an hour turning that into something professional they can send. The info's already there—it just needs to be restructured.

No database. This is an open-it-when-you-need-it tool. You paste your notes, it spits out a proposal, you're done.

The flow is simple: take messy meeting notes, extract the important bits (who's the client, what's their problem, what did you agree to build, what's it cost), then generate clean proposal copy organized into the sections clients expect—summary, the challenge, what you'll deliver, timeline, pricing, next steps.

Inputs are just the notes and your company name. Maybe a style preference if you want formal vs conversational. Output is markdown—clean enough to copy into a doc or convert to PDF.

Two prompts. First one extracts: client name, company, the problem they described, what's in scope, deliverables, timeline, pricing if it came up. Second one writes: takes that extracted structure and turns it into professional proposal language. No fluff, focused on outcomes.

The demo is satisfying: show the messy notes, run the tool, show the clean proposal. "That took 30 seconds instead of an hour."

The hook for the video: every consultant writes proposals, most hate it, this is a $100/hour task we're turning into a 30-second task.
