# Cold Email Writer

You need to reach out to someone cold—a potential client, a partnership, a guest for your podcast. You stare at the blank email trying to not sound like every other cold email in their inbox.

No database. Context in, email out.

The audience is anyone doing outbound—founders, salespeople, podcasters, networkers. The problem is that most cold emails are terrible: too long, too generic, too "me me me." Standing out requires genuine personalization and relevance.

Input: who you're reaching out to (name, company, what they do), why you're reaching out, what you want, any genuine connection or reason this isn't random spam. Output: a short, personalized cold email that might actually get opened.

The model writes with cold email best practices: short (under 100 words ideally), personalized opening (not fake-personalized), clear value prop, easy ask. The goal is a response, not a sale in one email.

One prompt that understands cold outreach. Feed it the context, have it output an email that feels like a human wrote it to this specific person.

Demo: "Reaching out to agency owner Jennifer Wong, saw she works with contractors, want to intro our verification tool." Run it. Show the email—3-4 sentences, specific to her, clear ask for a 15-min call. "This doesn't feel like spam because it isn't."

Hook: cold email works when it's relevant. This forces you to think about why they should care—then writes the email.
