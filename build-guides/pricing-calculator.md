# Pricing Calculator

You're quoting a project and you're not sure what to charge. You know your costs, you have a sense of the market, but turning that into a confident number is hard.

No database for the basic version. This is a thinking tool—inputs in, pricing recommendation out.

The audience is freelancers and consultants who struggle with pricing. Undercharging is common, overcomplicating is common, and second-guessing is universal.

Input: your costs (time estimate, hourly rate, any hard costs), the value to the client (what problem are you solving, what's it worth to them), market context (what do competitors charge, what's the client's budget range if known). Output: a recommended price with rationale, maybe tiered options.

The logic is part calculation, part strategy. Calculate the floor (your costs plus margin), estimate the ceiling (value to client), recommend something in between with reasoning. If you can offer tiers—basic, standard, premium—even better.

One prompt that thinks through the pricing logic. Give it your inputs, have it reason about value vs cost, output a recommendation you can use or adjust.

Demo: "I'm building a custom CRM, estimate 40 hours, my rate is $150/hour, client is a $2M agency." Run it. Show pricing tiers with rationale. "Now I'm not guessing, I'm deciding."

Hook: most freelancers undercharge because they're not confident in their numbers. This gives you the math and the reasoning to charge what you're worth.
