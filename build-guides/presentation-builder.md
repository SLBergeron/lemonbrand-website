# Presentation Builder

You need to give a talk or pitch. You have ideas but no structure. The blank slide deck is staring at you.

No database. This is ideation and structure—story in, outline out.

The audience is founders pitching, consultants presenting to clients, anyone who needs to stand up and communicate something coherent. The problem isn't making slides—it's knowing what story you're telling.

Input: what's the presentation about, who's the audience, what do you want them to do/feel/understand by the end, any key points you know you want to hit. Output: a structured outline with slide-by-slide breakdown, key talking points, and the narrative arc.

This is about methodology more than code. The model needs to think like a storyteller: who are the actors (you, the audience, the problem, the solution), what's the journey, where's the tension, what's the resolution?

One prompt, but it should think through: opening hook, context setting, the problem/opportunity, your solution or insight, proof points, call to action or conclusion. Each section becomes slides.

Demo: "I'm pitching my AI tool to a room of agency owners. I want them to book demos." Run it. Show the outline: hook, their pain, the shift happening in the market, what you built, why it works, next step. "Now I know what story I'm telling."

Hook: slides are easy. Knowing what to say is hard. This figures out your story before you touch PowerPoint.
