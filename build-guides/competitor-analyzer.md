# Competitor Analyzer

You're researching your market or a client's market. You need to understand what the competition is doing—features, pricing, positioning. Doing this manually means opening 10 tabs and taking scattered notes.

No database for the basic version. URLs in, comparison matrix out.

The audience is founders doing market research, consultants analyzing industries for clients, anyone who needs to understand a competitive landscape fast.

Input: a list of competitor URLs or names, optionally what you want to compare (features, pricing, messaging, target audience). Output: a structured comparison—who does what, where they overlap, where they differ, where the gaps are.

This one benefits from web fetching if you want live data, but you can also just paste in what you know about each competitor and have the model structure the comparison. The value is the structured thinking, not the data gathering.

One prompt that takes competitor info and outputs a matrix. Features across the top, competitors down the side, checkmarks and notes in the cells. Then a summary: "Competitor A focuses on enterprise, B on SMB, gap exists in X."

Demo: list three competitors in a space, describe what each does. Run it. Show the comparison matrix and the insight summary. "Now I can see where I fit—and where the opportunity is."

Hook: good strategy requires knowing the landscape. This gives you clarity in minutes instead of hours.
