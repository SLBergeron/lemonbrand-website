# Build Guides

28 narrative specs for 30-minute builds. Each one is a coffee-shop explanation of what you're building and why—enough to get your head in the space before you hit record.

## Your Stack

All builds use familiar tools:
- **Runtime**: Node.js
- **Database**: Convex (if persistent) or SQLite (if local)
- **AI**: Anthropic SDK
- **APIs**: As needed (censor keys in recording)

## Recording Notes

- Timer visible on screen (accountability, tension)
- Think out loud during prompts—show the conversation
- Censor API keys (edit in post or use env vars)
- Show iterations, not just final result
- Keep "make it pretty" phase brief—functionality first
- Aim for "that took 30 seconds instead of an hour" moment at the end
