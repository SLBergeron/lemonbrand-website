# Vendor Comparison

You're evaluating options—software tools, service providers, contractors. You've got tabs open, you're taking scattered notes, and making a decision feels paralyzing because you can't compare apples to apples.

No database. Options in, decision matrix out.

The audience is anyone making a choice between vendors or tools. The problem is that every option has different features, pricing structures, and trade-offs. Without structure, you compare based on vibes or whoever has the best marketing.

Input: what you're trying to accomplish, the options you're considering, what matters to you (price, features, support, integration, whatever). Output: a comparison matrix with each option scored on your criteria, plus a recommendation.

The model structures the decision. It takes your criteria, evaluates each option against them, and surfaces the trade-offs clearly. Not to make the decision for you—but to make the decision obvious.

One prompt that understands decision matrices. Feed it your options and criteria, have it output a structured comparison with scores and a summary of trade-offs.

Demo: "Evaluating email tools: ConvertKit, Mailchimp, Beehiiv. Care about price, ease of use, and deliverability." Run it. Show the matrix—scores on each criterion, overall recommendation with reasoning. "Now I can decide instead of researching forever."

Hook: analysis paralysis kills momentum. This turns open-ended research into a clear decision.
