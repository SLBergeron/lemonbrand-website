# Email Sequence Writer

You need a nurture sequence—maybe for new leads, onboarding, or re-engagement. You know what you want to accomplish but writing 5-7 emails that flow together and don't sound robotic is a project.

No database for the generator itself. Sequence strategy in, emails out.

The audience is founders and marketers who need email sequences but don't have a copywriter. The problem is that individual emails are manageable, but a sequence needs to tell a coherent story across multiple touchpoints.

Input: what the sequence is for (lead nurture, onboarding, win-back, etc.), who's receiving it, what you want them to do by the end, how many emails, how spaced out. Output: the full sequence—subject lines, body copy, CTAs—designed to flow together.

The model thinks about the arc. Email 1 introduces the problem. Email 2 builds credibility. Email 3 offers value. Email 4 handles objections. Email 5 makes the ask. Each email stands alone but they add up to something.

One prompt that understands email marketing fundamentals. Give it the strategy, have it output the full sequence with notes on timing and what each email accomplishes in the arc.

Demo: "I need a 5-email sequence for agency owners who downloaded my free audit, spaced 3 days apart, goal is to book a call." Run it. Show all 5 emails with subject lines and send timing. "That's a complete campaign I can load into my email tool."

Hook: sequences convert. Single emails don't. This builds the full journey in one shot.
