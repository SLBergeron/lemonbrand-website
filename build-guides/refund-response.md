# Refund Response Writer

Someone wants a refund. You need to respond—either granting it gracefully or declining it professionally. Either way, the tone matters. Handle it wrong and you get a bad review. Handle it right and sometimes they become a fan.

No database. Situation in, response out.

The audience is anyone who sells products or services and occasionally deals with unhappy customers. The problem is that refund requests feel personal, and responding while emotional leads to bad outcomes.

Input: what they bought, why they want a refund, your policy, whether you're granting or declining, any context about the customer relationship. Output: a professional response that handles the situation gracefully.

The model writes with the right tone. If granting: make it easy, no guilt, leave the door open. If declining: acknowledge their frustration, explain clearly, offer alternatives if possible. Never defensive, never dismissive.

One prompt that understands customer service psychology. Feed it the situation and decision, have it output a response you'd be proud to send.

Demo: "Customer bought a $97 course, says it wasn't what they expected after completing 80%. Policy is 30-day no questions asked. Granting refund." Run it. Show the response—graceful, no friction, invites them back. "This turns a loss into a future opportunity."

Hook: how you handle complaints defines your brand. This helps you respond like a pro even when you're frustrated.
