# Project Status Report

Your client wants an update. Or your team needs a weekly summary. You've been doing the work, but turning it into a coherent status report feels like extra overhead.

No database. Updates in, report out.

The audience is anyone managing projects—consultants, project managers, agency owners. The problem isn't that status reports are hard, it's that they interrupt the flow of actual work. So they get skipped, or done poorly, or sent late.

Input: rough notes about what happened this week, what's in progress, any blockers, what's coming next. Output: a clean, professional status report the client can actually read.

The model structures your scattered updates into the format clients expect: summary, completed items, in progress, blockers, next steps. Dates, context, the right level of detail—not too much, not too little.

One prompt. Give it your raw notes, specify the client/project if needed for context, have it output the formatted report. Maybe a few style options: formal, brief, detailed.

Demo: paste rough notes about a week's work. Run it. Show the clean report. "This is what the client sees. Professional, clear, took me 30 seconds instead of 20 minutes."

Hook: clients don't pay for status reports, but they judge you by them. This makes you look organized even when your notes are chaos.
