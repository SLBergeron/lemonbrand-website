# LinkedIn Post Generator

You know you should post on LinkedIn. You have things to say. But sitting down to write something that doesn't sound generic or cringe? That's the blocker.

No database. Topic in, post out.

The audience is founders, consultants, anyone building a personal brand who struggles with the blank page. The goal isn't to write *for* them—it's to give them a draft they can edit into their own voice.

Input: a topic or rough idea, maybe some bullet points of what you want to say, optionally some examples of posts you like (for voice matching). Output: a LinkedIn post draft, properly formatted with hooks and line breaks.

The trick is the prompt. LinkedIn has a specific cadence—short lines, hooks at the top, value in the middle, CTA or reflection at the end. The model needs to understand that format.

One prompt, but it needs good instructions about LinkedIn style: no walls of text, strong opening line, whitespace matters, end with engagement (question or takeaway).

Demo: "I want to write about why I stopped using Notion." Run it. Show the draft. "That's 80% there, I just tweak a few lines and post."

Hook: the hardest part of LinkedIn is starting. This gets you past the blank page in 30 seconds.
