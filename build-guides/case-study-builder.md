# Case Study Builder

You did great work for a client. You should turn it into a case study. But writing about your own work feels awkward, and structuring it takes time you don't have.

No database. Project details in, case study out.

The audience is agencies and consultants who need proof of their work but don't have time to write marketing content. A good case study is one of the best sales tools you can have—but most people have zero.

Input: client name (or anonymized), what they came to you with, what you did, what the results were, any quotes or feedback. Output: a structured case study with the classic format—challenge, solution, results.

The model's job is to take your rough notes about a project and turn them into compelling narrative. Not hype, not fluff—just clear storytelling about what happened and why it mattered.

One prompt, but give it the structure: start with the client's situation, what was at stake, then what you did (specific, concrete), then results (numbers if you have them, qualitative if not), then a quote or testimonial if available.

Demo: paste rough notes about a project, run it, show a case study that looks like it belongs on your website. "This is ready to publish."

Hook: social proof wins clients. This turns your past work into your best marketing asset.
