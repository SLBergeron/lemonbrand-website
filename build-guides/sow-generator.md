# Statement of Work Generator

You've agreed on a project. Now you need a formal SOW so everyone's clear on scope, deliverables, timeline, and what's not included. Writing these from scratch is tedious and you might forget something important.

No database. Project details in, SOW out.

The audience is consultants and agencies who do project-based work. The problem isn't legal complexity—it's thoroughness. A good SOW prevents scope creep and misunderstandings. A bad one leads to "I thought that was included" conversations.

Input: project overview, deliverables (specific and concrete), timeline with milestones, what's in scope, what's explicitly out of scope, assumptions, payment terms. Output: a formal SOW document ready for signature.

The model structures your inputs into proper SOW format with all the sections: overview, scope of work, deliverables, timeline, assumptions, exclusions, change process, payment terms, signatures. The value is completeness—it prompts you for everything that should be in there.

One prompt, but it should think through SOW best practices. The exclusions section is key—being explicit about what's not included saves you from scope creep later.

Demo: describe a project roughly. Run it. Show the full SOW with proper sections. Point out the exclusions. "This is what prevents the 'can you also just...' conversations."

Hook: scope creep kills projects. A good SOW is your first line of defense. This makes sure you don't forget anything.
