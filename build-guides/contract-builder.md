# Contract Builder

You need a service agreement. You could pay a lawyer $500, use some sketchy template from Google, or keep winging it with nothing in writing. None of these are great.

No database. Terms in, contract out. (Disclaimer: not legal advice, always have a lawyer review for real deals.)

The audience is freelancers and consultants who need basic service agreements but don't have legal budgets. The problem is that no contract means no protection—and bad contracts are sometimes worse than none.

Input: service description, deliverables, timeline, payment terms, what happens if things go wrong (revisions, cancellations, disputes), any specific clauses you need (IP ownership, confidentiality, non-compete). Output: a structured contract with proper legal-ish language.

The model generates from templates and best practices. It covers the standard sections: parties, scope, payment, timeline, IP, confidentiality, termination, limitation of liability, dispute resolution. You customize, you review, you send.

One prompt that understands contract structure. Give it your terms, have it output a document that looks professional and covers the bases.

Demo: describe a simple project with basic terms. Run it. Show the contract with proper sections. "This isn't a substitute for a lawyer on big deals, but for a $3K project? This gives you protection without the overhead."

Hook: handshake deals work until they don't. This gives you a starting point for getting things in writing.
