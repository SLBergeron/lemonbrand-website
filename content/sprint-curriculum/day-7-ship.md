# Day 7: Ship

**Status:** Final

---

## Overview

**Title:** You Built Something Real

**Subtitle:** Demo it. Share it. Celebrate. Then think about what's next.

**Duration:** 1 hour

---

## Learning Objectives

1. Create a demo video of your tool
2. Share your work with the cohort
3. Understand considerations for getting your tool adopted
4. Reflect on what you learned
5. Decide what's next for you

---

## First: Congratulations

Stop for a second.

Seven days ago, you had an idea. Maybe a vague one. Maybe you weren't sure if you could actually build it.

Now you have:
- A working tool
- Live on the internet
- That you built
- With your own hands (and a very helpful AI collaborator)

That's not nothing. That's huge.

Most people never build anything. They think about it. They plan to learn someday. They save tutorials they'll never watch.

You actually did it.

Whatever happens next - whether you use this tool every day or never touch it again - you proved something to yourself this week. You can build things. Real things. Things that work.

That's a skill that doesn't go away.

So before we get into the practical stuff: well done. Seriously.

---

## Key Concepts Introduced

**Shipping is a skill**
Building is one skill. Shipping is another. Getting something out into the world, sharing it, letting people see it - that takes a different kind of courage. Today, you practice that skill.

**Adoption has considerations**
A tool that only you use can be rough. A tool you want others to use needs more: documentation, support, buy-in. If you're building for a team or a company, there are politics and processes to navigate.

**This is the beginning, not the end**
The Sprint is over. Your building journey isn't. You now have a system, a set of skills, and (probably) a list of ideas. What you do with that is up to you.

## Lesson Content

### Part 1: Create Your Demo Video

You're going to record a short video showing your tool. Use Loom (free) or any screen recording tool.

**What to cover:**
1. What is this tool? (one sentence)
2. Who is it for?
3. Show it working - walk through the main flow
4. What are you proud of?
5. What would you improve in version 2?

**Keep it short:** 2-5 minutes is plenty.

Don't script it. Don't make it perfect. Just show what you built and talk about it like you're showing a friend.

> "Hey, let me show you this thing I made this week..."

That's the vibe.

---

### Part 2: Share With the Cohort

Post your video to the Discord.

Include:
- Your Loom link (or video file)
- Your live Vercel URL
- One thing you learned this week

Watch other people's demos. Leave comments. Celebrate each other.

This cohort went through the same struggle you did. They understand what it took to get here.

---

### Part 3: Considerations for the Real World

If this tool is just for you, you're done. Use it. Enjoy it.

But if you want others to use it - your team, your company, your clients - there's more to think about:

**For internal tools (your team):**
- You'll need documentation. "How do I use this?" should be answered somewhere.
- A simple README or "How to Use" page goes a long way.
- Ask Claude to help: "Create a simple user guide for this tool. Assume the user has never seen it before."

**For company tools:**
- Your IT team will have questions. Security, hosting, data handling.
- AI-built tools are new. Not everyone will be comfortable with them immediately.
- You may need to explain your process, show the code, or get approval.
- The tool working isn't always enough - there's organizational buy-in to consider.

**For client tools:**
- Professional presentation matters more.
- Consider: onboarding flow, error handling, support process.
- What happens when something breaks and you're not around?

**None of this should stop you from building.** But it's worth knowing: shipping to yourself is different from shipping to others. Both are valuable. Just different.

---

### Part 4: Reflect

Take a few minutes to think about:

**What did you learn?**
- About building with AI?
- About yourself as a builder?
- About the process of going from idea to working tool?

**What surprised you?**
- What was easier than expected?
- What was harder than expected?

**What would you do differently next time?**
- Scope differently?
- Plan more (or less)?
- Ask for help sooner?

Write these down. Future you will thank you.

---

### Part 5: What's Next?

You have options:

**Option 1: Keep using what you built**
Use your tool. See how it holds up. Notice what's missing. Improve it over time.

**Option 2: Build something else**
You have an ideas folder now. Pick one. Start the scoping conversation. You know the process.

**Option 3: Go deeper**
The Sprint taught you the fundamentals. The **8-Week Program** goes deeper:
- More complex projects
- Mobile and native apps
- Databases and authentication
- Building for production
- Advanced patterns and techniques

If you want to build more sophisticated tools - or turn this into a real skill you use professionally - the 8-Week Program is the next step.

**Option 4: Take a break**
You just did a Sprint. It's okay to rest. The skills don't disappear. The ideas will still be there when you're ready.

---

### Part 6: Stay Connected

The Sprint ends. The community doesn't.

- Stay in the Discord. Help newcomers. Share what you build next.
- Reach out if you get stuck on something. I read my emails.
- Post your wins. We want to see what you build after this.

You're part of a community of builders now. That matters.

---

## Deliverables

1. Demo video recorded (Loom or similar)
2. Video posted to Discord with Vercel URL
3. Watched at least 2 other cohort demos
4. Written reflection (for yourself)
5. Decision made: What's next?

---

## Final Note

You started this Sprint with an idea.

You ended it with a working tool, a deployed URL, a system for building, and a community of people who did it alongside you.

Not everyone finishes. You did.

That's worth something. Don't forget it.

Now go build the next thing.

— Simon

## Pedagogical Notes

- Day 7 is primarily celebratory, with practical considerations secondary
- The congratulations section is placed first and given real weight
- Demo format (Loom) is specific and approachable
- Real-world considerations (IT, documentation, buy-in) are introduced but not overwhelming
- Multiple "what's next" options validate different paths
- 8-Week Program is presented as clear option without being pushy
- Personal sign-off from Simon adds human touch
- By end of Day 7, they should feel: "I did something real. I can do it again."

## Video Script Notes: Gaps to Address

### Gap: How to actually record a Loom
Some students might not have used Loom before.

**Address in video:**
- Quick Loom walkthrough:
  1. Go to loom.com, create free account
  2. Install browser extension or desktop app
  3. Click record → Choose "Screen + Camera" or just "Screen"
  4. Record your demo
  5. Stop → Get shareable link
- Alternative tools: QuickTime (Mac), OBS, or any screen recorder
- "Don't overthink it. Phone recording your screen works too if needed."

### Gap: Demo anxiety - what if they're nervous?
Public speaking/demoing is hard for many people.

**Address in video:**
- "It's normal to feel nervous. You're sharing something you made."
- Tips:
  - "Pretend you're showing a friend, not presenting to an audience"
  - "It doesn't need to be polished. 'Let me show you this thing I built' is enough"
  - "You can re-record if you need to. Loom lets you try again."
- "The cohort is supportive. They went through the same struggle. They're cheering for you."

### Gap: Tool isn't working / embarrassing to demo
What if their tool broke or is embarrassing?

**Address in video:**
- "If your tool isn't working perfectly, demo it anyway."
- "Show what works. Acknowledge what doesn't. 'This part isn't finished yet, but here's what it does...'"
- "An imperfect demo is still a demo. You still built something."
- "No one expects perfection from a 7-day Sprint. Show what you learned, not just what you built."

### Gap: Organizational adoption is more complex than presented
The curriculum touches on IT/company considerations but it's actually quite complex.

**Address in video:**
- "If you want to use this at work, here's the reality:"
  - Small company / you're the founder: Probably fine to just use it
  - Larger company: IT will have questions about security, hosting, data
  - AI-built tools are new: Some people will be skeptical. That's okay.
- "Start by using it yourself. Prove value. Then bring others in."
- "If you need buy-in, show the result first. 'Look what I built' is more compelling than 'Let me explain AI coding.'"
- "Documentation helps: A simple README or user guide makes it easier for others to adopt."

### Gap: What if they didn't finish?
Some students might reach Day 7 without a working tool.

**Address in video:**
- "If you didn't finish, you still learned. A lot."
- Options for demo:
  1. "Demo what you have - even if incomplete. Show the journey."
  2. "Show the plan visualization from Day 2 + what you learned about why it was hard."
  3. "Talk about what you'd do differently. That's valuable."
- "Not finishing doesn't mean failure. It means the scope was wrong or the week was busy. That's information for next time."
- "If you got stuck, post in Discord. Others can help. You might still ship something."

### Gap: 8-Week Program pitch might feel sales-y
How to present it authentically.

**Address in video:**
- Frame honestly: "The Sprint taught you the fundamentals. It's intentionally limited in scope."
- What 8-Week adds:
  - Database integration (real persistence)
  - Authentication (user accounts)
  - Mobile apps
  - More complex architectures
  - Production-level patterns
- "If you're curious but not ready, that's fine. Build more tools first. The program isn't going anywhere."
- "If you're excited and want to go deeper, this is the path."
- No pressure: "The skills you learned this week are valuable on their own. 8-Week is an option, not a requirement."

### Gap: What happens after the Sprint ends?
Students might feel abandoned when the structure goes away.

**Address in video:**
- "The Sprint ends. The community doesn't."
- Stay connected:
  - Discord stays active
  - Share what you build next
  - Help newcomers with questions
  - Post wins, ask for help
- "You now have a system. You don't need the Sprint structure to keep building."
- "The real test: A month from now, did you build something else? That's when you know it stuck."
